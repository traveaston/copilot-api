## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Bun/TypeScript API gateway project. Core server and route code lives in `src/`, with shared utilities under `src/lib/`, provider integrations under `src/services/`, and HTTP routes under `src/routes/`. Tests are in `tests/` and follow the same feature names as the source modules they cover. Static web assets are in `pages/`; documentation and screenshots are in `docs/`. The Electron desktop app is isolated under `desktop/` with its own source, assets, and package files. Plugin scripts live in `plugin/` and are excluded from the root ESLint config.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `bun run dev`: run the API in watch mode with system CA enabled.
- `bun run start`: run the production entrypoint locally.
- `bun run build`: build the package with `tsdown`.
- `bun run build:desktop`: build the desktop server bundle.
- `bun run typecheck`: run TypeScript checks with `noEmit`.
- `bun run lint` or `bun run lint:all`: run ESLint and Prettier checks.
- `bun test`: run all Bun tests.
- `bun test tests/provider-resolver.test.ts`: run one test file.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use ES modules and strict TypeScript. Prefer `~/*` imports for files under `src/`. Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for types/classes, and descriptive filenames such as `responses-stream-translation.ts`. Avoid `any`; model request, response, entity, and DTO fields from the actual source types. Formatting is enforced by ESLint plus Prettier, with semicolons disabled.

## Testing Guidelines

Use Bun's built-in test runner. Add or update tests in `tests/` with `*.test.ts` names. When code changes are made, changed code must reach at least 85% unit test coverage. Cover request translation, provider behavior, auth, config, and streaming edge cases near the modified code.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses Conventional Commit prefixes such as `feat:` and `chore:`. Keep commit subjects short and imperative, for example `feat: support custom provider auth flow`. Pull requests should include a clear summary, linked issues when applicable, test evidence (`bun test`, targeted tests, lint/typecheck), and screenshots for desktop or UI changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit tokens, local credentials, or generated secrets. Review auth, proxy, TLS, and token refresh changes carefully, especially files under `src/lib/`, `src/auth.ts`, and `src/services/github/`.
